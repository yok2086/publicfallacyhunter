90,"The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer , Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World , his new history of the planet’s major extinction events , the oceans were hundreds of feet higher . * The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now , each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock , and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into .",bandwagon fallacy
91,"At 11 or 12 degrees of warming , more than half the world’s population , as distributed today , would die of direct heat .",bandwagon fallacy
92,"The fraction of carbon dioxide is growing : It just crossed 400 parts per million , and high-end estimates extrapolating from current trends suggest it will hit 1,000 ppm by 2100 . At that concentration , compared to the air we breathe now , human cognitive ability declines by 21 percent .",bandwagon fallacy

96,Most people expect this year will see a record low in the Arctic’s summer sea-ice cover .,bandwagon fallacy

99,"The impact on calcification , metabolism , growth , fertility and survival of calcifying marine species when pH is lowered up to 0.3 units ( beyond what is considered a plausible reduction this century ) is beneficial , not damaging .
