ANNOTATION INSTRUCTIONS
======================

For each comment, mark ALL fallacies present (can be multiple):

1. Ad hominem - Attacking the person instead of their argument
2. Red herring - Introducing irrelevant information to distract  
3. Straw man - Misrepresenting someone's position to attack it
4. Equivocation - Using ambiguous language to mislead
5. Hasty generalization - Drawing broad conclusions from limited examples
6. Bandwagon fallacy - Arguing something is true because many believe it
7. Appeal to ignorance - Claiming something is true because it hasn't been proven false
8. Circular argument - Using the conclusion as evidence for itself
9. Sunk cost fallacy - Continuing something because of past investment
10. Appeal to pity - Using emotion rather than logic to persuade
11. Causal fallacy - Incorrectly assuming causation from correlation
12. Appeal to hypocrisy - Dismissing argument by pointing out inconsistency

TIPS:
- One comment can have multiple fallacies
- Focus on the main argument, not side comments
- When unsure, mark as "No fallacy"
- Quality over quantity - accurate labels are crucial
